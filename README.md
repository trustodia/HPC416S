# [ HPC416S: High performance Computing for 16SrRNA]
Author: Trust Odia

[This project is aimed at providing high performance computing (compute resource) for metagenomics analysis ]

[ Welcome to my project, and thanks for deciding to contibute.
The problem with genomic data analysis is storage, memory and processing power. I have been able to curate a draft workflow with some scripts, aimed at solving a fraction of metagenomics analysis (sequence level of 16SrRNA analysis).
To perform complete metagenomics analysis, high performance computing power is requred, especially with data containing large number of samples.
Can we ceate/build an open HPC/compute resource for metagenomics analysis, with remote access?]

## Getting Started
To contribute/collaborate to this project, [join us here](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/HPC416S),and 
1. provide a list of open/free/public/accessible compute resources/HPC(e.g Amazon,Azure clouds) that we can use.
2. provide ideas/tools/materials on how to build (1) above. (if you already have one, are you willing to give us access?)
3. Migrate the scripts on this repo to (1) above, this is done after Step (1)

Note: The scripts on this repo are for performing 16SrRNA analysis at the sequence level,
i.e when you don't have information about your samples. See [Manual](Manual.md)
